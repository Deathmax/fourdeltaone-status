FourDeltaOne Status Project
===========================

These are the source codes for the fourDeltaOne status project I work on. I
recently decided to make the source codes public since most of the project
became stable enough and I like to share (cleaned up and working) code.

What does this repository include
=================================

Right at the moment, this repository includes the source code from the following
parts of the project:

- Status backend (API)

Following parts are still to be included completely:

- Status frontend (Webpage)
- Status bot (IRC bot)
